            Inception centers around a name called Dom Cobb who is a highly-skilled infiltrator of the human mind during dreams 
            and extracts <br> corporate secrets at the behest of others. Due to trauma of the past, Dom is no longer able to return
            to his children and thus seeks to <br> take one final job to come back to his children.
